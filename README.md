A minimalist 2D game framework implemented in (mostly) C89*, in early stages of development.

## features:
* basic 2D batched renderer
* ECS
* Linux and Windows platform layers for keyboard and mouse input, window creation and OpenGL context creation
* Simple math library
* Rudimentary asset packer/loader

## to do:
* Sound
* Font rendering
* UI system
* Serialisation
* Documentation
---
*uses variadic macros and `stdint.h`, so not really c89.
